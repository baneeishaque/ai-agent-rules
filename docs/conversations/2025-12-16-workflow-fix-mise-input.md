# Conversation Log: Workflow Fix for mise-action Input

**Date**: 2025-12-16
**Objective**: Diagnose and fix a failed GitHub Actions workflow in `mise-setup-verification-action`.

## 1. Request

The user reported that the last run of the `test.yml` workflow failed and asked to fetch logs via `gh`, analyze the failure, and fix the workflow.

## 2. Analysis

The user provided the error logs directly:

```text
##[warning]Unexpected input(s) 'mise_file', valid inputs are ['version', 'sha256', 'mise_dir', 'tool_versions', 'mise_toml', 'install', 'install_args', 'install_dir', 'cache', 'cache_save', 'cache_key_prefix', 'cache_key', 'experimental', 'log_level', 'working_directory', 'reshim', 'github_token', 'fetch_from_github', 'env']

```

**Root Cause**: The `action.yml` was passing `mise_file` as an input to `jdx/mise-action@v3`, but the correct input name is `mise_toml`.

## 3. Implementation Plan

A simple one-line fix was proposed:

- **File**: `action.yml`
- **Change**: `mise_file: ${{ inputs.mise_file }}` → `mise_toml: ${{ inputs.mise_file }}`

The plan was approved by the user.

## 4. Execution

The fix was applied to `action.yml`:

```diff
-        mise_file: ${{ inputs.mise_file }}
+        mise_toml: ${{ inputs.mise_file }}

```

## 5. Current State

- The fix has been applied locally.
- Commit and push pending (user cancelled initial command to request commit message rule compliance).
