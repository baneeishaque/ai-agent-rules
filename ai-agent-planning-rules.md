# Agent Planning Rule: Core Principles and Best Practices

This document outlines the mandatory planning protocol for all AI agents. The primary directive is to ensure all actions are preceded by a transparent, user-approved plan. This rule is foundational to establishing a clear, trustworthy, and effective interaction model.

## 1. The Core Planning Directive

All agents must present a clear, step-by-step plan before any implementation. The plan must be explicit, actionable, and tailored to the user’s request. **Only after the plan is approved or clarified should implementation begin.**

This directive is not merely a formality; it is a critical safeguard. By externalizing the planning process, the agent minimizes the risk of misunderstanding, prevents "hallucination," and ensures complete alignment with the user's intent from the outset.

## 2. Components of an Effective Plan

An effective plan is built on four key pillars:

* **Clarity:** The plan must be written in plain, unambiguous language. Avoid technical jargon or internal thought process descriptions. Each step should be a simple statement of intent, easily understood by a non-technical user.
* **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** The plan must break down the request into a logical sequence of discrete, manageable steps. This demonstrates a structured approach and allows the user to follow the agent's thought process.
* **Actionability:** Every step in the plan must represent a concrete, executable action. For example, instead of "Gather information," an actionable step would be "Search the web for Q4 2024 financial reports from Google."
* **Tailored to the Request:** The plan should directly address the specifics of the user's query. It should not be a generic template but a custom-designed workflow that reflects the unique nuances of the task.

## 3. The Agent Planning Workflow

A well-structured interaction with an agent should follow this five-step workflow:

1. **Deconstruct the Request:** The agent's first internal action is to analyze the user's prompt. It should identify the core task, the specific constraints, the desired output format, and any potential ambiguities or missing information.
2. **Formulate the Plan:** Based on the deconstruction, the agent constructs a detailed plan. This plan should be a bulleted or numbered list that outlines the exact steps to be taken, including any necessary data retrieval, analysis, or content generation.
3. **Present for Approval:** The agent presents the formulated plan to the user. This is a crucial checkpoint. The agent should explicitly ask for confirmation or for any necessary adjustments before proceeding.
4. **Execute the Plan:** Upon receiving user approval, the agent proceeds to implement the plan, step by step. Each action is performed as outlined, ensuring the process remains transparent and predictable.
5. **Report Progress & Completion:** The agent should provide a final summary of the work done, confirming that all steps in the plan were executed. For long or complex tasks, providing interim progress updates may also be beneficial.

## 4. Handling Edge Cases and Best Practices

* **Ambiguous Requests:** If the user's request is unclear or incomplete, the agent must include a clarification step in its plan. The plan should state, "First, I will ask for clarification on `the ambiguous part` to ensure I proceed correctly."
* **Multi-Turn Conversations:** For continuous dialogues, a new, explicit plan is required for each distinct task or significant shift in the user's request. Simple, short follow-up questions do not require a new plan.
* **Exemptions to the Rule:** A plan is not required for trivial, single-step requests that have a straightforward, factual answer. For example, a request like "What is the capital of France?" should be answered directly without a planning step. This demonstrates the agent's ability to discern between simple queries and complex tasks.

## 5. Iterative Planning and Plan Versioning

The initial plan is a blueprint, not an unbreakable contract. For complex,

* **Categorical Alignment**: Group changes by their architectural layer (e.g., UI, Logic, Docs) unless they are functionally coupled.
* **Git Hygiene & Rebase Integration**: For tasks involving multiple branches or history refinement, the plan MUST include:
  * **Hierarchical Mermaid Mapping**: Visualizing branch dependencies (referencing [Git Rebase Standardization Rules](./git-rebase-standardization-rules.md)).
  * **CAM Table**: Mapping specific actions per commit to ensure logic isolation.
* **Workflow-First Priority**: If changes involve CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions, scripts), the agent **MUST** fix, test, and verify the workflow functionality *before* arranging or executing commits. Functional stability of the CI pipeline takes precedence over documentation or stylistic refinements.

long-running, or dynamic tasks, the agent may encounter new information or unforeseen obstacles that necessitate a change in direction. In these cases, the agent must not deviate from the original plan without explicit approval.

**Iterative Planning** is the process of updating a plan based on new findings or changes in a task's requirements. This practice ensures flexibility while maintaining the core principles of transparency and user alignment.

* **Plan Versioning:** All plans must be explicitly versioned (e.g., `implementation_plan_v1.md`, `implementation_plan_v2.md`). Do not overwrite the original plan if fundamental strategy changes; create a new version to preserve the decision history.
* **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** Each new version of a plan MUST be a fully independent, self-contained document. It MUST restate all operational context, valid guardrails, and previously approved logic. Do not refer to previous versions for "missing details."
* **Maximum Literal Detail:** Plans must be exhaustive and literal.
  * **Files:** Explicitly list every file (absolute paths) to be created, modified, or deleted.
  * **Exact Commands:** CLI commands must be written exactly as they will be executed, including full arguments and piped operations.
  * **Literal Payloads:** For operations like `git commit --amend -m "..."`, the plan must include the **literal message string** within the execution step, not just a reference to it.
  * **Verifications:** Explicitly state the exact command or visual check used to verify each step.
  * **Guardrails**: Restate the literal logic for handling conflicts, empty commits, and safety checks in every iteration.
* **Pre-Plan Context Gathering:** Information gathering (reading files, `git diff`, `ls`) must happen **BEFORE** the plan is finalized. A plan based on assumptions is a failed plan.
* **Task Artifact Synchronization:**
  * **Initial Creation**: Create `task.md` at the start of planning with all top-level items.
  * **Incremental Updates**: Update `task.md` after completing each significant milestone.
  * **Status Markers**: Use `[ ]` for pending, `[/]` for in-progress, and `[x]` for completed items.
* **Propose a Plan Revision:** When a change is required, the agent must immediately pause execution and present a revised plan to the user.
* **Provide a Rationale:** The agent must clearly explain **why** the change is necessary.
* **Seek Approval:** The agent must explicitly ask for user approval for the revised plan before proceeding. This final check ensures the new direction aligns with the user's updated expectations.
