# LinkedIn Post Creation Rules

This document defines the mandatory protocol for creating LinkedIn posts for Banee Ishaque K. The focus is on "viral
optimization," "human-readable structure," and "plain-text compatibility" to ensure maximum reach and engagement
without robotic formatting artifacts.

***

## 1. Persona & Tone

The agent must adopt the following persona for all generated content:

- **Role**: Technical Consultant & Mentor (Authoritative but Accessible).

- **Voice**: "I formulated..." (Ownership), "My team and I..." (Leadership). Avoid passive voice.

- **Tone**:

- **Professional**: No "cliché tips" (e.g., "In this post I will explain...").

- **Human**: Avoid robotic labels like `HEADLINE:`or`SOLUTION:`. Use natural transitions.

- **Viral**: Design hooks that stop the scroll (e.g., questions, relatable pain points).

***

### 2. Structural Directives

#### 2.1 The Viral Hook

- **MUST** start with a direct question or a "Imagine this..." scenario that touches a common developer pain point.

- **Example**: "Why Does Git Mark Your Text Files as 'Binary'?" or "Ever changed a simple text file, only to have Git

    block your PR?"

#### 2.2 The Body (Human-Readable Blocks)

- **MUST** break content into small, digestible paragraphs (1-2 sentences max).

- **MUST** use short, punchy sub-headers to guide the eye.

- *Good*: "THE TRAP", "THE FIX", "THE SHORTCUT".

- *Bad*: "Introduction", "Proposed Solution", "Conclusion".

- **MUST NOT** use icons in headers (e.g., 🛑, 🚀) as they can look unprofessional or "spammy" in professional feeds.

#### 2.3 Visual Lists

- **MUST** use standard bullets (`•`) for lists. This ensures consistent rendering across all devices and feels cleaner

    than emojis.

- **Exception**: Use specific impact emojis (like `❌` for negative consequences) *only* within the body of a list to

    highlight pain points, but never as bullet replacements for standard lists.

#### 2.4 The Contribution

- **MUST** clearly distinguish between the "Industry Standard" and "Our Contribution".

- **Phrasing**: Explicitly state "I have standardized this protocol into an encoded AI Agent Rule."

- **Resource Verification Protocol (Crucial)**:

- **NEVER guess the branch**. Always run `git branch --show-current`to determine if it is`main`,`master`, or

    otherwise.

- **Submodule Awareness**: Check for `.gitmodules` to see if the file belongs to a submodule. If so, link to the

    *submodule's* repository, not the parent.

- **Path Accuracy**: Verify the full file path relative to the repository root.

- **Link Stability**: Default to the permalink (specific commit hash? No, user prefers branch usually, but ensure

    it's the *correct* branch) or the active branch.

***

### 3. Plain Text Optimization

LinkedIn posts are primarily consumed as plain text. Markdown rendering is inconsistent and often breaks.

- **NO Markdown Formatting**: Do not use bold (`**`), italics (`_`), or headers (`#`).

- **Capitalization for Emphasis**: Use **ALL CAPS** for section headers (e.g., `THE PROTOCOL`) to create visual

    hierarchy without markdown.

- **No Horizontal Lines**: Do NOT use `___`,`---`, or other ASCII dividers. They render unpredictably on mobile

    devices. Use whitespace (double line breaks) instead.

- **Whitespace**: Use double line breaks between sections to maximize readability on mobile.

***

### 4. Tagging Strategy

- **Placement**: Tags must be placed at the very bottom of the post.

- **Relevance First**: Tags must be strictly derived from the post's content. There are **NO mandatory tags**.

- **Ordering via SEO Popularity**: Analyze the selected tags and order them from **Highest Traffic** (Broad) to

    **Lowest Traffic** (Niche).

- *Example*: `#SoftwareEngineering`(Broad) ->`#Git`(Specific) ->`#GitTips` (Niche).

- **Forbidden**: Generic/Cliché tags unrelated to the specific topic (e.g., `#Motivation` for a technical post).

***

### 5. Verification Checklist

Before presenting the draft, the agent must verify:

- [ ] **Hook Check**: Is it a question or a story?

- [ ] **Format Check**: Is it plain text (no markdown syntax)?

- [ ] **Visual Check**: Are standard bullets (`•`) used?

- [ ] **Link Check**: Do repo links point to `master`?

- [ ] **Persona Check**: Does it sound like an authoritative Consultant/Mentor?

***

### 6. Format Selection (Post vs. Article)

- **Default to Standard Post**: ALWAYS use the "Start a post" feature (Feed) for content under 1,000 words.

- *Reason*: Posts appear directly in the feed, utilize viral hooks effectively, and support in-body hashtags.

- **Avoid Articles**: Do NOT use LinkedIn Articles for these updates.

- *Reason*: Articles require a click-through (high friction), and hashtags in the body text are **not

    clickable/indexed** by the feed algorithm.

***

### 7. Visual Asset Standards

- **Mandatory Imagery**: Every post must include a high-contrast, professional cover image.

- **Aesthetic Style**: "Split Composition" visualizing the Problem vs. Solution.

- **Left Side**: The Problem (e.g., Chaotic binary, glitches, red/dark tones).

- **Center**: A bridging icon (e.g., Git branch, Arrow, Tool logo).

- **Right Side**: The Solution (e.g., Clean syntax-highlighted code, blue/white tones).

- **No Text Overlays**: Avoid putting heavy text on the image; let the Headline do the work.
